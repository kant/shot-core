### Security

There is none! Shot List Server is not a secure web service, and is not meant to be hosted on an internet-accessible IP. It does a bunch of stuff for simplicity-sake (e.g.: hand-rolled SQL queries) that makes it a security risk.

No real data integrity checks. We donâ€™t protect against errant data, e.g.: in a URL with project, scene, and shot ids, we trust that the project and scene ids you provide us are connected to the shot id you provide us.
